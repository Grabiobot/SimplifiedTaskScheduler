# Simplified Task Scheduler
## What is it
**Simplified Taks Scheduler** is a tool that automatically executes predefined commands at the specified time. For example, you can schedule a task to run a backup script every Monday and Thursday.

**Simplified Taks Scheduler** is able to execute script files, including **PowerShell** scripts, **Python** scripts, **.bat files** and so on. 
Obviously, it runs any .exe files with parameters or without paramters. 

## Why
I created this project in order to have a tool to help me schedule my backup scripts after I failed to use PowerShell scripts in Microsoft's Task Scheduler. 

## Goals
While developing this piece of software I aimed:
* to create a tool that **helps debugging task execution errors**
* to create a tool that will **run all sorts of scripts**

## Current Status
The current version is the first release so it is possible to have some flaws and I have a few ideas how things can be improved, but **everything in there should be working just fine**.
Let me know if you encounter any issue.

## System Requirements
This project is coded in .Net Framework 4.6.2 so the requirements for it are the **requirements from .Net Framework 4.6.2**.
See [.NET Framework system requirements on microsot.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements).
